With "the best views on Exmoor" that can be appreciated from inside the beautiful conservatory. As the house faces west seeing breath-taking sunsets and a herd of Red Deer is not out of the ordinary.

Picked Stones is the perfect equestrian property, the farm has direct moorland access, and it is possible to ride for hours with little to no roadwork, with miles and miles of tracks and bridleways and hunting on the doorstep.

The farm has ample parking for trailers and lorries. There was once a very successful cross country course here.

The house comfortably sleeps 9, there are two double en-suite rooms on the first floor, and the whole of the top floor is a family room with an en-suite bathroom. On the ground floor there is a sofa bed located in the second sitting room. There is also a shower and WC on the ground floor.

Exmoor is the best kept secret of all the UK's [national parks](http://www.nationalparks.gov.uk), located straddling the Devon and Somerset county border in the south west of England.
